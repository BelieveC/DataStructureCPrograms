Write an algorithm to remove all the nodes from a given linked list that have a greater value to their right.
 Example I: Input: 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> 20 -> 5 -> 16 -> 25 -> 8 -> NULL
 Output: 20 -> 25 -> 8 -> NULL 
Example II Input: 10 -> 12 -> 15 -> 20 -> 25 -> 26 -> 30 -> 40 -> NULL 
Output: 40 -> NULL
